        A DSLR camera is a camera that operates with a fixed, digital sensor.<BR> It can autofocus and hold thousands of photos on its internal memory card, making it a favorite camera choice for both pros and entry-level photographers alike.
        <br>When light enters the camera lens of a digital SLR camera, a photographer sees their subject in the optical viewfinder via a reflection of that light from a mirror inside the camera body. As the photographer snaps the photo, the mirror swings out of the way, and the light goes through to the digital image sensor to capture the photo on an SD card.<br> This is different from mirrorless cameras, where the light goes directly to the image sensor, and the photographer sees what theyâ€™re shooting via a rear LCD screen or an electronic viewfinder.
